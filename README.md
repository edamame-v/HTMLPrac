# HTMLPrac
Ok so.

It's been a *hot* minute since I've touched HTML.

I mean, sure, I did rework my personal blog, but I always has a simple plan for that one.

I'm gonna be working on a new HTML project in the coming weeks, so I need to make sure that my skills are up to speed.

So, yeah.

Since I have no client needs to meet here, I'm just trying out things I knew *how* to do, and that I *liked* doing, before I stopped.

So, yeah! Here's to tearing hair out over CSS :D

-Cheers!
